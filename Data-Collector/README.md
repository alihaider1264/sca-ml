# Introduction 
A Git Dif generator, each dif creates a seperate file with a each commit's version of a file or method along with some metadata about the commit in another file. The hope is that this can be used to create training data for machine learning.

# Usage
##    GitDownloader
        A simple program to download a git repo and if desired all of it's branches into a folder seperated into subdirectories defined by their branch name.

##      LogGen
        Generates GitLogs for every file that uses a file format defined as defined in the launch paramaters and in fileformats.JSON. It can also generate logs for every method in a file. These methods are found using ctags and seperated by using git's built in features (This feature doesn't work too well, it uses git log's method argument)

##      Interface
        Used to make Gitdownloader and LogGen work together. It can use a JSON file generated by ghs (githubsearch by Seart https://seart-ghs.si.usi.ch/) to define the repos it downloads and generates logs for. 

##      GitLogParser
        Parses the logs from LogGen and creates files structered in this way:
        (folder):
        (Code)(Metadata) Both of the files are named "iteration".txt and "iteration".py. For example the first commit has iteration 0. These files are generated until there is no more commit difs.
